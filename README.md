# Motivation
As seasoned SysAdmin and DevOps guy, I often use bash scripting and python for automation and realize that rather than continually copying scripts and inappriopriate code just anywhere, I'm storing these here for my own usage and anyone else who may find it helpful. Suggestions for improvements are most welcome.

# Resources
I have also find the following repo, links and materials useful for my daily reference;

# Contents
Meanwhile, I have section the whole thing based on languages use for these scripting; BASH and Python. So all the scripting will be found inside each directory
