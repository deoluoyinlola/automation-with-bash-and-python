## Contents
I have section the whole thing based on languages use for these scripting; BASH and Python. So all the scripting file for specific task will be found inside each directory accordingly.

## Motivation
As seasoned SysAdmin and DevOps guy, I often use bash scripting and python for automation and realize that rather than continually copying scripts and inappriopriate code just anywhere, I'm storing these here for my own usage and anyone else who may find it helpful. Suggestions for improvements are most welcome.

## BASH vs Python
Although they have a lot of overlap in the purposes they serve, Bash scripts are mostly just shell commands that have been chained together, sometimes along with loops or conditional statements, and Python is a full fledged programming language, capable of creating everything from basic automation scripts to programs with graphical user interfaces.

|  Category | BASH | Python |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What is it? | Bash is a command line interpreter | Python is a high level programming language |
| Purpose | Interpret user commands and automate tasks | Application and web development, automation |
| Best suited for | Smaller and simple scripts, Linux systems | In depth programs with many lines of code, multiple systems |
| Simplicity | Simply runs the same commands as you would enter in terminal | Can use objects and libraries to create complicated code |

## Tools
- BASH
- IPython
IPython is an interactive command-line terminal for Python.
- Python libraries; AWS Boto3 and others
AWS Boto3 is the python library for AWS, AWS SDK to create, configure and manage AWS services, like EC2, S3, etc.
